# The Witcher Mechanic

## Project Description
This project showcases a dynamic game mechanic inspired by "The Witcher" series. It includes a reactive Witcher Medallion that detects nearby enemies or magic within the game environment. This mechanic is designed using Unreal Engine 5, demonstrating both Blueprints and C++ implementations.

## Features
- Detection of enemies within a certain radius.
- Visual feedback (debug spheres) to indicate the detection range.
- Integration with Unreal Engine 5â€™s physics and collision system.

## Installation
To get started with this project:
1. Ensure you have Unreal Engine 5 installed on your system. You can download it from the [Epic Games Launcher](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download).
2. Clone the repository to your local machine: ``git clone https://github.com/Yushikuni/TheWitcherMechanic.git``
3. Open the project in Unreal Engine 5 by navigating to the project folder and opening the `.uproject` file.

## Usage
- The medallion can be triggered by pressing the "Y" key, which toggles its sensitivity settings between detecting enemies and detecting magical objects.
- To integrate this mechanic into your own game, reference the `AMedailon` and `ATheWitcher` classes in your game scripts or blueprints.
